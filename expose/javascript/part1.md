1. Line 9 prints `values added: 20`. Since `add` is `true`, the if-statement executes. Inside the `if` block, `var result` is declared and set to 0, then immediately updated to `num1 + num2` which is `10 + 10 = 20`. The `console.log` at line 9 then prints this updated value.
2. Line 13 prints `final result: 20`. Since `var` is function-scoped, the `result` variable declared inside the `if` block is still accessible outside of the block but inside the same function. Therefore, at line 13, the value of `result` (which is `20`) is still available and gets printed without error
3. We should avoid using `var` because it is function scoped and not block scoped. This means variables declared with `var` are accessible anywhere inside the function, even outside the block they were defined in (like an `if` statement or a `for` loop). This has the potential to cause unexpected behavior, bugs, and naming conflicts because variables might accidentally overwrite each other or be modified from other parts of the function. Using `let` and `const` is better as they are block-scoped, and thus have more predictable behavior
