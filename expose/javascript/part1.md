1. Line 9 prints `values added: 20`. Since `add` is `true`, the if-statement executes. Inside the `if` block, `var result` is declared and set to 0, then immediately updated to `num1 + num2` which is `10 + 10 = 20`. The `console.log` at line 9 then prints this updated value.
2. Line 13 prints `final result: 20`. Since `var` is function-scoped, the `result` variable declared inside the `if` block is still accessible outside of the block but inside the same function. Therefore, at line 13, the value of `result` (which is `20`) is still available and gets printed without error
3. We should avoid using `var` because it is function scoped and not block scoped. This means variables declared with `var` are accessible anywhere inside the function, even outside the block they were defined in (like an `if` statement or a `for` loop). This has the potential to cause unexpected behavior, bugs, and naming conflicts because variables might accidentally overwrite each other or be modified from other parts of the function. Using `let` and `const` is better as they are block-scoped, and thus have more predictable behavior
4. Line 9 prints `values added: 20`. Since `add` is `true`, the if-statement executes. Inside the `if` block, `let result = 0` is declared and updated to `num1 + num2` which is `20`. `console.log` at line 9 prints this value without any issue because `result` is still in the same block scope.
5. Line 13, the code returns a **ReferenceError**. Since `let` is block scoped, the `result` variable is only accessible inside the `if (add) {}` block. When we try to access `result` outside the block at line 13, JS is not able to find it and thus it throws a `ReferenceError: result is not defined`
6. By line 9, the code has thrown a `TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.`. When we use `const`, it means that the variable cannot be reassigned after its initial assignment. At line 7 (`result = num1 + num2;`), the code tries to reassign a new value to `result`, which was declared as `const`. This causes a type error - even before line 9 is reached. Nothing gets printed - code crashes at line 7 itself.
7. At line 13, the code does not reach this point because it already crashes earlier (at line 7) due to the `TypeError` when trying to reassign a `const` variable.  
Thus, **nothing is printed at line 13**.
